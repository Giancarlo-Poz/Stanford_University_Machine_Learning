This study is looking at a medication for  Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, a condition which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it hard for the heart to pump blood.

The medication is designed to help with symptoms of shortness of breath and improve exercise capacity in these patients. At this stage of testing we are seeking healthy participants, where we will assess how this medication is metabolised in the body.â€¯
